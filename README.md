# PartitionList


Divide a list to lists of N size.


The list is generic and can take any type of element

I have made a Unit test with Junit 5 for list of String and List of Integer elements.

I have used Java 8 Stream API + grouping collector for implementation (Less code to write) but the most optimal solution is to use Guava or Apache commons libraries.
